# negation_for_common_sense

Observations with negation are rarely found in commonsense knowledge resources. Enough observations with negation are not present in the training data. This leads to poorer performance when dealing with negation. ATOMIC is a comprehensive dataset and knowledge graph designed to enhance machine learning models' understanding of common sense reasoning in the form of if-then statements. To create ATOMIC, the authors devised a crowd-sourcing framework that encourages annotators to generate statements by completing prompts. ANION is another dataset that introduced negated and contradicted events. Although it raises inference quality, there is still much room for improvement. They crowd sourced a new large scale resource, Array of commonsense Inferences for Oppositions and Negations (ANION), which contains inferences for different types of negated events. In our work, we are planning to make the knowledgebase bigger and better by introducing more samples automatically with negation. So we donâ€™t have to collect data from crowd source works which will save time and money. To determine whether this new generated data genuinely increases performance, we intend to test it with various well-known downstream tasks.
